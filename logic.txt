The logic behind the solution is that it is possible to divide the area of the 6 rectangles into 720
different combinations of widths and heights.
Each combination represents a possible position for the 6 rectangles
let's assume we have these areas as input [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
The first rectangle can have any width from 1 to the area of the first rectangle. For example, if the area of the first rectangle is 4, then the first rectangle can have a width of 1, 2, 3, or 4.

Once we have chosen the width of the first rectangle, we can then choose the width of the second rectangle.
The width of the second rectangle must be less than or equal to the remaining area.
For example, if the remaining area is 3, then the second rectangle can have a width of 1, 2, or 3.
We can continue in this way to choose the widths of all 6 rectangles. At each step, we must choose a width that is less than or equal to the remaining area.
This means that there are a total of 8 possible combinations of widths and heights for the 6 rectangles.

We can know that these positions will work because they satisfy the following two conditions:
1-The sum of the widths of the rectangles is equal to the sum of the heights of the rectangles.
2-No two rectangles overlap.
